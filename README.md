# OpenCause
A crowdfunding platform where anyone can raise money for anything—from dream trips to emergency help. Think GoFundMe, but built by me.
A modern crowdfunding app that lets users create and support fundraising campaigns, whether it’s for a noble cause or just getting your cat a tiny yacht. Inspired by GoFundMe but built from scratch with full-stack tech.

👩‍💻Users can:

- Set up campaigns with images, goals, and stories
- Browse trending fundraisers
- Donate securely (or fake-donate in dev mode 😎)
- Manage campaigns via a sleek dashboard
- This project is a sandbox for learning real-world app architecture, user flows, and clean UI design—all rolled into one ambitious clone.

🚀 Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB
